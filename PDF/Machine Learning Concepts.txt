Step 1 : Load and Explore Data

Why:

Purpose: to understand its structure, types, and quality before modeling.

ML concept: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) ensures your data is clean and usable. ML models fail if data has issues(e.g. missing values, wrong types).

Relevance: Crypto data has trends(e.g., Bitcoin's 2021 spike), which you need to visualize to confirm it's suitable.

What:

pd.read_csv: Loads a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame (table-like structure).

df.head(): Shows the first 5 rows (e.g., Date, Open, Close).

df.info(): Lists columns, data types (e.g., float64 for prices, object for Date), and non-null counts.

df.describe(): Gives stats (mean, min, max) for numeric columns (e.g., Close mean ~$20,000).

df.isnull().sum(): Counts missing values per column (e.g., Volume might have 10 missing).

plt.plot: Plots Date vs. Close to see price trends (e.g., upward trend in 2021).

What If:

Skip Loading: No data, no project!

Wrong Path: Get FileNotFoundError or unicodeescape (use r'path').

Skip EDA: Miss critical issues (e.g., missing Close values crash the model).

Donâ€™t Visualize: Miss trends (e.g., crypto volatility) that inform feature engineering.
