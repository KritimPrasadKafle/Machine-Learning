Automation is process of removing the manual activity.
Something tedious and mostly -> solution is automation.

Shell scripting is way to automate the thing in the process of work for any devops engineer.

ls -> listing directories
ls -ltr -> to get the file names and directories.
man (command name) to get what all command it has.
vi/vim -> to create the file and write inside it.
touch -> used in automations
shebang -> #!/bin/bash
In every .sh file there would be shebang(#!/) in first line. 


bash/dash/sh/kash -> executable
