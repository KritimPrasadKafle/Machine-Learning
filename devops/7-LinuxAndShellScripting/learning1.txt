Automation is process of removing the manual activity.
Something tedious and mostly -> solution is automation.

Shell scripting is way to automate the thing in the process of work for any devops engineer.

ls -> listing directories
ls -ltr -> to get the file names and directories.
man (command name) to get what all command it has.
vi/vim -> to create the file and write inside it.
touch -> used in automations
shebang -> #!/bin/bash
In every .sh file there would be shebang(#!/) in first line. 


bash/dash/sh/kash -> executable

When you are writing shell scripting always write /bin/bash

What is the difference between /bin/sh and /bin/bash?
Previously both the concept were same because /bin/sh was redirecting using the linking concept to /bin/bash but now it is not same because some of the operating systems have decided to use Dash as default so your script might not execute if you are writing in bash scripting on a machine where dash is default.
