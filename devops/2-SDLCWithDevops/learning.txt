Software Development Lifecycle(SDLC)
-> Design
-> Develop
-> test
SDLC is the pattern or a way followed by the companies to deliver a high quality of product.

We are building an application for example E-commerce and have a different phase:
planning -> defining -> designing -> building -> testing -> deploying

This is the circular process.

Planning -> Requirements -> core members -> business analytics or senior members
Defining -> defining requirements in the documentation (Software Requirement Specification)
Designing -> HLD or LLD -> Senior will make a design.
After these process devops will come more handy.
Building -> Developing(once the senior comes up with the planning, defining and designing then building comes)
Testing -> code would be taken and tested out. QE will test the server.
Deployment -> Prod(if everything goes fine from the QE).

Devops engineer fastens the process.

Everything happens in a automated way.
