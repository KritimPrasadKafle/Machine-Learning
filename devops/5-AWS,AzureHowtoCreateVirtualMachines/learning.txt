Virtual Machine
AWS -> VM (EC2)
As a devops engineer you should look for the efficiency. So we need to make a automation.

AWS EC2 API

Script can be written using the AWS CLI, AWS API(Boto3 of python), AWS CFT, Terraform, AWS CDK.

These all scripts will directly interact with the AWS EC2 API.

Virtual machine or EC2 is the infrastructure.

Basically this is done if a person should have to make a 10 EC2 instance.

If org is using AWS then it would be used for the long term then AWS CDK is good one.

Hybrid cloud platform

Terraform should be used if we are having a hybrid cloud platform.
