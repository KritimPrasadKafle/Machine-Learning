The OSI Model:
OSI is a model that standardized the communication in computer systems it is what the internet runs on it is what your phone uses your land your router everything that communicate with each other in computer system uses this model in one way.

OSI -> open systems interconnection model.

Example:

ComputerB(10.0.0.2)(connected with router)   
Computer(10.0.3)(Connected with router)                
                           RouterA(10.0.0.1)      
PhoneD(10.0.0.5)(connected with router)     
ComputerF(10.0.0.4)(connected with router)


We have a bunch of network connection here we have a beautiful router. we have bunch of machines connected to this router could be Ethernet could be WIFI.

MAC address -> Media Access Control

10.0.0.3 is a web server having an web app and 10.0.0.5 want to consume it.

GET / 10.0.0.3 80 (Http headers cookies, content-type etc.)   Layer 7 Application
Encrypt if necessary                                          Layer 6 Presentation
Establish session tag it                                      Layer 5 Session
123 | Add ports/seq 80   123 | Break into segment | 80        Layer 4 Transport
10.0.0.5   |   10.0.0.3    10.0.0.5 | 10.0.0.3                Layer 3 Network
(Packets are sended here)
D  |    C     D |     C      D    |    C                      Layer 2 Data Link
(Here things gets assembled) D - us  C - target machine 
0110001110101010101001010100101010100100111                   Layer 1 Physical



It sends this 0110001110101010101001010100101010100100111 to every single machine.
But the one who is not trying to receive will drop these frames and will ignore it.
It is done in the network layer. 10.0.0.3.80 is trying to receive it because it access 80 port.

ComputerB(10.0.0.2)(connected with router)   
Computer(10.0.3)(Connected with router)                
                           RouterA(10.0.0.1)      
PhoneD(10.0.0.5)(connected with router)     
ComputerF(10.0.0.4)(connected with router)


So people say don't connect to the public network.

OSI :
7. Application Layer : Human-computer interaction layer, where applications can access the network services
6. Presentation Layer : Ensures that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs
5. Session Layer : Maintains connections and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions
4. Transport Layer : Transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP
3. Network Layer : Decides which physical path the data will take
2. Data Link Layer : Defines the format of data on the network
1. Physical Layer : Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium.
